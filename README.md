# Amazing Portfolio

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

When you load a single-page application portfolio for a web developer, you are presented with a page that has a header, a content section, and a footer. The header contains the developer's name and a navigation bar with titles for the different sections of the portfolio. The navigation bar titles are "About Me", "Portfolio", "Contact", and "Resume". The title of the current section is highlighted.

When you click on a navigation title, the corresponding section is displayed below the navigation bar without the page reloading. The title of the new section is highlighted. When you load the portfolio for the first time, the "About Me" title and section are selected by default.

The "About Me" section contains a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them. The "Portfolio" section contains titled images of six of the developer's applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories. The "Contact" section contains a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message. If you move your cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text, you will receive a notification that the field is required. If you enter text into the email address field, you will receive a notification if you have entered an invalid email address.

The "Resume" section contains a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer's proficiencies. The footer contains text or icon links to the developer's GitHub, LinkedIn, and third-party profiles (Stack Overflow, Twitter).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
