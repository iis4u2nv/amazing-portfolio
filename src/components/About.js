        <p>Participating in a bootcamp represented new opportunities. It gave me the opportunity to rebuild my career, rekindle my passion, and—perhaps most importantly—rediscover my resolve.
        Prior to starting my bootcamp, I had been working as a title examiner for ten years. I felt like I had hit a wall.
        I could not see where I was going to be in the next five years, But, I started thinking of a career change, and programming came across my mind as a potential path.
        I had no programming experience, but I had something else that was just as important—grit. I took a chance and signed up for the UCF Bootcamp Full-Stack-Developer class.</p>
