        <p>
          Transitioning from a successful 20-year career in finance and real estate, I'm now leveraging my business acumen to build user-friendly 
          websites that convert visitors into leads and boost sales.  I'm deeply invested in understanding the online needs of businesses, 
          especially in finance and real estate industries.
          Recently, I completed a full-stack web development certificate program at the University of Central Florida, where I honed my skills
          in both front-end and back-end development.  My capstone project involved building a website for connecting hikers of all backgrounds 
          that resulted in a community engagement that celebrates the spirit of wanderlust, sharing personal journey, and inspiring others
          to explore the boundless beauty of our planet's natural landscapes.
          As a highly organized and resourceful problem-solver, I thrive in collaborative environments working in a team to bring projects to life.
          I'm eager to connect with businesses looking to establish a strong online presence and leverage the power of the web to achieve their
          growth goals.
